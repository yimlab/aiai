        <h1>Call for Papers - International Workshop on Accelerators Infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence (AIAI)</h1>

        <p>Workshop date: Dec 17-20, 2025<br>
            In conjunction with the 32nd IEEE International Conference on High-Performance Computing, Data, & Analytics (HiPC 2025)<br></p>

        <p>AIAI 2025 is the international workshop dedicated to novel concepts and empirical findings in accelerators infrastructure for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Machine Learning (ML). The inaugural edition of the AIAI workshop aims to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offer a forum for academic researchers and industry practitioners in the fields of Accelerators, Software, Systems, and AI/ML to evaluate the application of full-stack HPC techniques and frameworks, thereby fostering dialogue and problem-solving within these domains.
            <li>Showcase pioneering research and practical implementations that capitalize on the convergence of Accelerators, Software, Systems, and AI/ML. This platform will facilitate knowledge exchange regarding emergent tools, techniques, characteristics, design patterns, and exemplary practices.
            <li>Deliberate upon the challenges inherent in integrating accelerator infrastructure for AI/ML and propose viable solutions. Furthermore, it seeks to delineate future research trajectories and incentivize collaborative endeavors to advance the field.
        </ul>

        <h2>Topics of interest</h2>
        <p>Topics of interest include all aspects of computational accelerator infrastructure for GenAI and ML applications. The workshop specifically solicits submissions encompassing measurement, analytics, evaluation, and other experimental techniques pertinent to the design, implementation, optimization, and operation of accelerators. We address computational accelerators for both cloud computing and mobile/embedded/IoT devices. Relevant techniques are categorized as follows:</p>

        <h2>Submission guidelines and instructions</h2>
        <p>The AIAI Workshop invites the submission of unpublished manuscripts. Submissions must not be concurrently under review for other conferences, journals, or workshops. Manuscripts are limited to four (4) pages, formatted in single-spaced, 10pt, double-column, IEEE conference style. Each submission must include the title, author(s), affiliations, and the email address of the corresponding author.</p>

        <p>All submitted manuscripts will undergo a single-blind review process by the Program Committee. Each submission will be reviewed by a minimum of three reviewers, unless it is desk-rejected due to formatting or topic relevance issues.</p>

        <p>Authors of accepted papers will have the chance to present their work at the HiPC 2025 conference. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register for the conference and to give the talk if the paper is accepted.</p>
